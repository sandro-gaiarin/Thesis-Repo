  description: "(scrawled on a sheet of loose leaf paper) Jim, I\u2019m writing this
    because I don\u2019t want anyone to overhear. No matter what they offer, don\u2019t
    volunteer to join the squad in charge of working on the Calcutron Construct.
    I get these bots are meant to be safer than magic users but\u2026 I saw them
    take someone out of there on a stretcher, one of their legs all mangled up. I
    don\u2019t want to see you get hurt. "

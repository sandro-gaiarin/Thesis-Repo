  description: "Memorandum: All Echelon Institute Employees RE: The 33rd Street Warehouse
    \tAs you are all aware, we are closing up active operations at the 33rd Street
    Warehouse. Operation 8450 has moved on to its next stage, and polling operations
    have concluded. Thank you to everyone who made the long commute, we appreciate
    the service. As a reminder, time spent commuting will NOT be compensated, and
    all requests for such will be rejected. If you were operating out of the warehouse,
    please contact your supervisor for instructions on your new workplace. As a reminder,
    we will not accommodate work from home requests. The warehouse will continue
    to be used to house backup copies of documents. Security will remain in place
    until after the election, after which it will no longer be necessary. Thank you
    all for your dedicated service. - The Board of Directors "
